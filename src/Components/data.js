Resume Filter is a program companies can use to automate their process of giving out interviews to the most qualified candidates. The project was coded in Prolog, with the help of s(CASP) in the command line. This hackathon was a challenge to me and my team because we were not experienced in logic programming languages. Scoring amongst 6 finalists was an accomplishment for my team.',
