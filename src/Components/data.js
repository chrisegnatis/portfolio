Utilizes TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and dynamic API calls to fetch current data, and error handling for API call misses. Best Practices implemented to create maintainable and reliable code. Website makes over one-thousand API calls.',
        // paragraph: 'At UTD Hackreason 2022, an AI themed hackathon, my team created a finalist project called Resume Filter. Resume Filter is a program companies can use to automate their process of giving out interviews to the most qualified candidates. The project was coded in Prolog, with the help of s(CASP) in the command line. This hackathon was a challenge to me and my team because we were not experienced in logic programming languages. Scoring amongst 6 finalists was an accomplishment for my team.',

        // paragraph: 'My inspiration for this project was to learn JavaScript and have fun doing it. Since I used to love playing video games, I decided to create a video game. The game is very simple: you control a Mars Rover and try to collect diamonds while avoiding incoming asteroids. Developing this game helped me apply object-oriented programming and data structures skills that I had learned in school, and it also got me into programming with the Reactjs framework which is very exciting.',

I was able to apply strong coding practices for assembly languages such as protecting the scope of variables, creating meaningful procedures, support for error handing and input variation, and strong documentation. The calculator supports up to 32-bit calculations (2s complement) and currently supports binary, decimal, and hexadecimal calculation.',
        // paragraph: 'This project, which I created over a span of a couple weeks, demonstrates my ability in MIPS assembly language. I found this project challenging because it involves lots of complex procedures, calculations, and changing from character to number values: all in an assembly language. This project taught me how to make well-documented procedures, create consistent and modifiable code, and many other good programming practices.
